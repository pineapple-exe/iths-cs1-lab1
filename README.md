This program takes a string as an argument and highlights the "proper substrings" of that string, as well as prints the sum of those substrings.

###### Proper Substring Criteria:
- It purely consists of digits.
- It begins and ends with the same type of digit.
- The first and last character are the only occurrences of that specific digit.
